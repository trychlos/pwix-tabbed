## Todo

|   Id | Date       | Description and comment(s) |
| ---: | :---       | :---                       |
|    1 | 2024- 1-12 | TabbedTemplate: the application should be allowed to block a pane change, even if the user changes the route or select another tab of another TabbedTemplate |
|      |            | or anything else - use case: prevent losing unsaved changes on a pane |
|    2 | 2024- 1-13 | identify in the README the localStorage used when managing the tabs |

|    3 | 2024- 7-11 | seems that the first tab at initial display is not advertized |
|      | 2024- 7-11 | actually it is sent, but - at initial display - only shown events are sent - not the hidden ones as there is no previous tab at that moment |
